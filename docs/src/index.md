# Agtor.jl

Agtor is an actor-based zonal agricultural cropping/water management model.


# Description

Agtor is designed to facilitate interdisciplinary exploratory scenario modelling of agricultural systems and related system interactions. Agtor operates at a zonal scale where the zone may represent an individual farm/field, sub-catchment area, or the catchment itself.

Based on an earlier version developed for the Lower Campaspe region in North-Central Victoria.
See [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2020.100669).

Contributions are welcome.


# Why the name "Agtor"?

The model represents agricultural actors within a system and so the name is a portmandeau of "agriculture" and "actor".
